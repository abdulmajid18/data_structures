"""Design a program that takes as input a size k, and reads packets, 
continuously maintaining a uniform random subset of size k of 
the read packets.
Hinf: Suppose you have a procedure which selects k packets 
from the first n > k packets as specified. How
would you deal with the (n + 1)th packet?"""
